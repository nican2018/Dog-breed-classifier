# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App 

---

In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! 

> **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut.  Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

The rubric contains _optional_ "Stand Out Suggestions" for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the "Stand Out Suggestions", you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook.

### Why We're Here 

In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!).

In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

### The Road Ahead

We break the notebook into separate steps.  Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook.

* [Step 0](#step0): Import Datasets
* [Step 1](#step1): Detect Humans
* [Step 2](#step2): Detect Dogs
* [Step 3](#step3): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* [Step 4](#step4): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* [Step 5](#step5): Write your Algorithm
* [Step 6](#step6): Test Your Algorithm

## Step 0: Import Datasets

Make sure that you've downloaded the required human and dog datasets:

**Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you *DO NOT* need to re-download these - they can be found in the `/data` folder as noted in the cell below.**

* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `/dog_images`. 

* Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/lfw`.  

*Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.*

In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays `human_files` and `dog_files`.
